About this fork
===============

This is a fork of odoo docker official image. We make the fork for this reasons:
* We want to use more recent nighty odoo builds and official repository is updated only after some months
* We are more used to work with ubuntu, so we change to ubuntu as base image, for that, this adjustaments:
    * replace wkhtmltox version
    * not install python-support as not anymore on ubuntu 16.04
* On default odoo, as there are no locales, when creating a new database and loading language  (for eg. es_ar), no correct language info is loaded (for eg date format). It is also much easier to create locales on ubunto rather than in debian
* On v11 we reduce disk use purging python 2.7, dev packages and removing unused files related to wkhtmltox installation
